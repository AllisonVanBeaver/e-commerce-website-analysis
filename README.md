The current analysis reveals a 61% bounce rate for traffic directed to the home page. 
In light of this, it is advisable to explore the viability of an alternative home page. 
I recommend initiating an A/B experiment to divert a portion of users to the proposed alternative home page and subsequently comparing the bounce rates between the existing and experimental home pages.

I leveraged advanced SQL functions, including temporary tables and aggregate functions, to conduct in-depth website content analysis for an e-commerce enterprise. 
Through this analysis, I identified insights related to the most-viewed pages by customers and the bounce rate of traffic directed to the home page. 
These findings not only contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the current online landscape but also pinpoint specific areas of improvement for the business.
